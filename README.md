# ðŸ©¸ Blood Donor Prediction

This project predicts whether a person is likely to donate blood again, based on historical donation data. The goal is to assist blood banks and healthcare organizations in identifying potential future donors.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Predict whether a blood donor will donate again based on features like:
- Recency (months since last donation)
- Frequency (number of past donations)
- Monetary (total blood donated)
- Time (months since first donation)

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach

- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Deployment (Streamlit or Flask)

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Results

| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|-------------------  |----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 88%      | 0.87     |
| Decision Tree       | 86%      | 0.85     |

## ðŸ’¡ Future Work

- Improve performance with advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy to cloud (Render, Heroku, etc.)
